Pushing changes to master branch will turn these sources to static html pages. The hard work is done by Jekyll.

If you want to develop these, you should install Ruby + Jekyll according to documentation at http://jekyllrb.com.

If you want to add content, get the code and create a pull request.

New posts go to _posts directory.

Use proper categories for posts, 'event' for events and 'blog' for blog posts.

Set the event date the actual date the event is held so they will be listed in chronological order.
Blog dates should be set to their creation date.
