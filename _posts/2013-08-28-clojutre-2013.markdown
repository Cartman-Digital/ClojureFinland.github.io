clojuTRE is a free event for all interested in Clojure and its usage
and applicability in real-world projects.

Event starts with a set of technical talks about clojure in the field &
some cool new tech thingies. After the talks which we'll head to sauna
facilities next door for open discussions, programming, beer and sauna
(towels included).

No previous experience from clojure is required, just bring yourself
open-minded. Bring also your own laptop if you want to do some hands-on
stuff in the evening, whether you are a newbie or not.
